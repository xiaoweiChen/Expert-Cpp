## 本书主旨

- Design professional-grade, maintainable apps by learning advanced concepts such as functional programming, templates, and networking
- Apply design patterns and best practices to solve real-world problems
- Improve the performance of your projects by designing concurrent data structures and algorithms

## 本书概述

C++ has evolved over the years and the latest release – C++20 – is now available. Since C++11, C++ has been constantly enhancing the language feature set. With the new version, you’ll explore an array of features such as concepts, modules, ranges, and coroutines. This book will be your guide to learning the intricacies of the language, techniques, C++ tools, and the new features introduced in C++20, while also helping you apply these when building modern and resilient software.

You’ll start by exploring the latest features of C++, and then move on to advanced techniques such as multithreading, concurrency, debugging, monitoring, and high-performance programming. The book will delve into object-oriented programming principles and the C++ Standard Template Library, and even show you how to create custom templates. After this, you’ll learn about different approaches such as test-driven development (TDD), behavior-driven development (BDD), and domain-driven design (DDD), before taking a look at the coding best practices and design patterns essential for building professional-grade applications. Toward the end of the book, you will gain useful insights into the recent C++ advancements in AI and machine learning.

By the end of this C++ programming book, you’ll have gained expertise in real-world application development, including the process of designing complex software.

## 作者简介

**Vardan Grigoryan** is a senior backend engineer and C++ developer with more than 9 years of experience. Vardan started his career as a C++ developer and then moved to the world of server-side backend development. While being involved in designing scalable backend architectures, he always tries to incorporate the use of C++ in critical sections that require the fastest execution time. Vardan loves tackling computer systems and program structures on a deeper level. He believes that true excellence in programming can be achieved by means of a detailed analysis of existing solutions and by designing complex systems.

**Shunguang Wu** is a senior professional staff at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, and received his PhDs in theoretical physics and electrical engineering from Northwestern University (China) and Wright State University (USA), respectively. He published about 50 reviewed journal papers in the area of nonlinear dynamics, statistical signal processing and computer vision in his early career. His professional C++ experience started with teaching undergraduate courses in the late 1990s. Since then he has been designing and developing lots of R&D and end-user application software using C++ in world-class academic and industrial laboratories. These projects span both the Windows and Linux platforms.

About the reviewers
Lou Mauget learned to program long ago at Michigan State University as a physics major,
learning to use software in designing a cyclotron. Afterward, he worked for 34 years at
IBM. He is currently consulting for Keyhole Software of Leawood, Kansas. Lou has coded
in C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, and newer languages, as each was conceived. Current
interests include reactive functional programming, containers, Node.js, NoSQL, geospatial
systems, mobile, and any new language or framework. He has coauthored three computer
books. He has written two IBM DeveloperWorks XML tutorials and co-written several J2EE
certification tests for IBM. He has been a reviewer for Packt Publishing and others.
Scott Hutchinson leads a team of C++ and F# developers in Oxnard, California. After a few
years as a VB/VBA developer, he started developing with .NET Framework immediately
after its launch in 2002. Since 2016, he has done most of his development in C++. He is a
mentor for the F# track on Exercism, and teaches functional programming in F# to his team
at work. His main professional interests are functional programming and machine learning.
When he's not learning some new software development skill, he's usually hiking in the
mountains of Southern California.
